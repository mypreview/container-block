== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 7.2 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater or MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
* WordPress version 5.0 or greater.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
 
In the search field type “Container Block”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation "Manual plugin installation").

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I use the block? =
1. Log into your WordPress website and navigate to Dashboard.
2. Create a new page, by visiting “Pages” » “Add New”.
3. Click on the “Add Block” button and select the “Container” block. Alternatively, you can start typing `/container` in a new paragraph block, then press enter.
4. “Container Block” can contain other blocks. You can add content by clicking the `+` icon and picking a block.
5. Publish the page.

= Why should I use a container block in a page? =
The container div, and sometimes content div, are almost always used to allow for more sophisticated CSS styling. The body tag is special in some ways; However, browsers don't treat it like a normal div, and its position and dimensions are tied to the browser window.

= I need help customizing this plugin? =
